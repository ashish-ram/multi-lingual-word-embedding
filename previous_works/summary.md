# Ready-made solutions:
	1. Google's word2vec implementation in C/C++, optimized version, 
	uses CBOW, N-skipgram model internally 
	https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/

	2. Facebook's fast-text: 
	Source literature: [fasttext](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04606.pdf)
	Link: https://research.fb.com/fasttext/
	Type of model: 
	Other information:
	Capability: implementation source code + ready to use package, pre-trained model and word vector on wiki-dump




# Data Sets:
**A compiled list can be found in the google word2vec page**
