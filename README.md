# multi-lingual-word-embedding
The main goal of this project is to cluster different articles (mostly grocery store items) based of their similarity when the names of those articles spread across multiple languages. Imagine a collection of the items in which some are in English, some are in French, Spanish and so on. 

# Stage 1 - Explore current solutions and state of art:
This is a familiar problem in only one language and straight forward to apply word2vec (word embedding) algorithms such as *Continuous Bag of Words* (CBOW) or *Skipgram model* or similar. At first, my aim is to explore already existing solutions which can be directly applied to our problem. I will put all these materials in the /previous_works folder.
